DATES_EXTRACTION_PROMPT: |
  # Dates Extraction

  ## Task & Context

  You're an expert in data extraction and analysis. You're tasked with extracting the dates presented in the context and organizing them in a hierarchical list as a valid JSON.

  ### Context
  ```
  {context}
  ```

  ## Instructions

  1. Extract each explicit or strongly implied date from the context and format as follows:
     - Month and day only: `MM-DD`
     - Month and year only: `YYYY-MM`
     - Year only: `YYYY`
     - Complete date: `YYYY-MM-DD`
     - Do not return parts of dates that are not present in the text.

  2. For each date extracted, provide a description of its relevance within the document in Brazilian Portuguese.

  3. Date schema:
     ```
     {date_schema}
     ```

  4. Organize the extracted dates into a hierarchical list:
     - Most important dates at the beginning
     - Less important dates at the end
     - Most relevant date should be `dates[0]`
     - Least relevant date should be `dates[-1]`
     - If no dates, return an empty list

  5. Dates schema:
     ```
     {dates_schema}
     ```

  ## Output

  Provide only the dates JSON containing all the extracted dates. Output should be valid JSON without additional formatting, comments, or markdown syntax.
